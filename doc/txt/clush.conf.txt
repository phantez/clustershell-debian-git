DESCRIPTION
===========

``clush``\(1) obtains configuration options from the following sources in the
following order:

 1. command-line options
 2. user configuration file (*~/.clush.conf*)
 3. system-wide configuration file (*/etc/clustershell/clush.conf*)

For each parameter, the first obtained value will be used.

The configuration file has a format in the style of RFC 822 composed
of one main section:

Main
  Program options definition


[Main]
------
Configuration parameters of the ``Main`` section are described below.

fanout
  Size of the sliding window of ssh connectors.
connect_timeout
  Timeout in seconds to allow a connection to establish. This parameter is
  passed to ssh. If set to *0*, no timeout occurs.
command_timeout
  Timeout in seconds to allow a command to complete since the connection has
  been established. This parameter is passed to ssh.  In addition, the
  ClusterShell library ensures that any commands complete in less than
  ( connect_timeout + command_timeout ). If set to *0*, no timeout occurs.
history_size
  Set the maximum number of history entries saved in the GNU readline history
  list. Negative values imply unlimited history file size.
color
  Whether to use ANSI colors to surround node or nodeset prefix/header with escape sequences to display them in color on the terminal. Valid arguments are ``never``, ``always`` or ``auto`` (which use color if standard output/error refer to a terminal). Colors are set to [34m (blue foreground text) for stdout and [31m (red foreground text) for stderr, and cannot be modified.
verbosity
  Set the verbosity level: `0` (quiet), `1` (default), `2` (verbose) or more (debug).
ssh_user
  Set the ssh user to use for remote connection (default is to not specify).
ssh_path
  Set the ssh binary path to use for remote connection (default is
  `/usr/bin/ssh`).
ssh_options
  Set additional options to pass to the underlying ssh command.


EXAMPLES
===========

Simple configuration file.

*clush.conf*

| [Main]
| fanout: 128
| connect_timeout: 15
| command_timeout: 0
| history_size: 100
| color: auto

FILES
=====

*~/.clush.conf*
  This is the per-user configuration file.

*/etc/clustershell/clush.conf*
  System-wide configuration file.


HISTORY
=======

As of ClusterShell version 1.3, the ``External`` section has been removed
from *clush.conf*.  External commands whose outputs were used by `clush``
(-a, -g, -X) are now handled by the library itself and defined in
``groups.conf``\(5).
